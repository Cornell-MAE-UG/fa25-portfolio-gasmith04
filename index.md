## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/G_profile-pic.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
I'm {{ site.name }}, a 3rd year Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University with a strong interest in sustainable design. My academic and project experience has focused on energy systems, experimental testing, and practical design for real-world constraints. I enjoy working at the intersection of analytical modeling and hands-on engineering—using tools like SolidWorks, MATLAB, and Excel to move ideas from concept through prototyping, testing, and iteration.

I’m interested in roles that blend engineering, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Long term, I wish to help develop products and systems that are technically sound, environmentally responsible, and thoughtfully designed for the people who use them.
